atprophecy is examin it crumblesthr day andthr night      now we com upon a prophecy suppos ut by the verymou of the god jes himself  he speak of his crucifict andresurrect       mt    for as jonah was in the bel of the       whal for three day and three night so wil the son       of man be in the heart of the ear three day and       three nightsbef any furth discuss can occ it is necess to knowhow the jew understood day  as far as day nam went each was hour long last from sunset pm to the follow sunsetpm  what was refer to as a day was the period of light fromam to the end sunset at pm  thu accord to our timesc a sabba day beg at pm friday ev and last untilpm saturday ev  thi is why the jew celebr theirsabba on the daylight port of saturday instead of sunday it seem lik a real mirac that christians didnt forget thatsaturday was indee the seven and last day of the week  thuswh day and night ar refer to togeth  hour daylightport and  hour night period ar being spok of  thusjes say that he wil be in the grav or in hel or otherwiseunresurrect for three day and three night      as the good book tel us jes was cruc on the ninthho which is pm friday afternoon  he then was put into thegrav sometim aft that  then jes left the grav rosebef dawn of what we cal sunday the dawn aft the sabba wasov  what thi mean is that jes was us our tim forcl in the grav from pm friday night to som tim befoream sunday morn  we could also ad a littl tim bef pmfriday sint the bibl is not spec her  what thi meansus jew tim is that he was in the grav for on day twonight and poss a coupl of hour of

on of matthew littlemistak and that the gospel writ put fals word into hisgod mou   and no mat who mad the predict it is moreth unconvint it is counterconvincinghear understand     jes tool on a habit

prophecy of isaiah which say        you wil indee hear but nev understand and you       wil indee see but nev perceiv  becaus thi       peopl heart has grown dul their ear ar heavy of       hear and they hav shut their ey so the they       would not perceiv with them her with their ear and       understand with their heart and turn for me to heal       themth origin isaiah pass ar part of his ear work hiscal to the min  thi is in  bce when israel isflo right bef it fal und the auth of assyr isaiah see the good tim end and also a vis from gdcalling him to bring reform to israel and judah       is   and gd said go and say to thi       peopl hear and hear but do not understand see and       see but do not perceiv   mak the heart of thi       peopl fat mak their ear heavy and shut their       ey so they wil not see with their ey or hear       with their ear and understand with their heart and       turn and be heal  then isaiah said how long       lord  and he said until the city lie wast       without inhabit and hous without men and the       land is ut desol and the gds tak men far       away and forsak plac ar many in the land  and       though a ten wil remain in it it wil be burn

not a predict of what is to com in any ev  theserv is thought of as a crimin  thi also hap to fit thedescrib of jes  had the pass real been about themessiah it stil is not at al clear why execut jes betweentwo thiev would fulfil the prophecy in isaiah  jes wouldm fit fulfil it with his whol min  he wasconsid a blasphem and troublemak al throughout hisc   lock onto a singl ev is a rath poor way

to suit his theolog  in thi caseth embroidery cre som embarrass problem as we haveseenth end of theworld       mt        now com perhap on of the most extraordin andembarrass pass in the new testa  it is found in allthr of the synopt gospel story and cast som of the mostunfavo doubt on the whol the of christianity  jesus the destruct of the jew templ and build andh discipl ask him about thi and about the end of the worldwhich he has been warn about       the discipl tel us when wil thi the templ       destruct be and what wil be the sign of yo       com and of the clos of the ag       jes tak car that no on lead you astray for       many wil com in my nam say i am the christ         you wil hear of war and rumo of war for       thi must tak plac but the end is not yet   for       nat wil ris against nat al thi is but the       begin of the birthpang             they wil del you up put you to dea       and fals prophet wil ar and lead many astray       but he who end to the end wil be sav  thi       gospel wil be preach throughout the whol world a       testimony to the nat and then the end wil com             so when you see the desol spok of by the       prophet daniel let thos who ar in jude fle to       the mountain             immedy aft the trib of thos day       the sun wil be dark the star wil fal from       heav then wil appear the sign of the son of man       in heav and al the trib of the ear wil mourn       and see the son of man com and he wil send out       his angel and gath his elect             learn the lesson of the fig tre as soon as it       branch becom tend and put for leav you know       that sum is near  so also when you see al thes       thing you wil know that he is near at the very       gat  tru i say to you thi gen wil not       pass away until al thes thing tak plac             but of the day and hour no on know not the       angel not the son but on the fath theref       you also must be ready for the son of man is com       at an hour you do not expectfrom thi it is clear that jes thought the world would inwithin the lifetim of at least som of his discipl  he tellsthem that although he doesnt know the exact day or hour that itwil com and thu they must be ready  theolog hav wettheir pant in pan to find som way out of thi holy er but unfortun jes mad himself to explicit  he told hisdiscipl that their gen would stil be around at the endand that they in particul should prep for it prep to beswept away      ther hav been som who resort to remov the inerrantn of the bibl and said that the phrase thi generationshal not pass away real mean thi rac of peopl wil notpass away  of cours the word for gen is us manytim to ref to exact that the gen of the discipl it is an interest not that when god decid to learn greekh didnt learn it wel enough to mak himself clear  but it isquit obvy from the rest of the dialog that the discipl atleast som of them ar suppos to liv to the end of the world the charg of mistransl is complet blown away by look the apostl respons  it becom abund clear fromrev   pet   john  and rev  that jesusm exact what he said  the end was very near       for  year christians hav rat thi

the new testa and oth  ear christian writ bauerarndtgingrichth new analys greek lexicon perschbacher coupl simply stat hang oneself and a coupl wer mor explicit and stat that apacgw mean spec kil yourself by hang acoupl also not that the mean of on the root word for apacgw isstrangl throttle or chok which pretty much invalid the guy whosuggest to david joslin that juda was hung upsid down  on of the bestref though robinson greek and engl lexicon of the newtesta not on stat the transl it gav both the root word thelit transl rel greek word which us the sam root and alsooth pres spec exampl of the word in greek lit to givefurth context  the word apagchw has two root word gchw is the to strangle root andth root word apo mean lit away thi root word is includ inword which denot a transit  it can mean a transit in plac eg thegreek word apagello mean to send a mess  apo can also denot achang in stat and spec the chang from lif to dea  robinsonspec mak comparison to the word apokteiuo which mean to killin lit mean the word apacgw mean to throttle strangle to put outof the way and implicit denot a chang in lif stat ie away froml to dea  so whil the word apacgw doe mean to hang itspec denot a dea as wel  thu robinson is quit spec when hest that it mean to hang oneself to end on lif by hang he thennot the the us of apacgw in hom odessy  to denot context  hepres that exampl of apacgw as being us to explicit mean suicid byhang now sint ther is a perfect good word for strangling without thead denot of dea and as you insist that the bibl was writ bygod and every word is prec correct you ar stuck with the completem of apacgw ie sint the word apacgw was us then dea isdenot as the result by the way i not that mr decenso also pres an exampl of apacgwnot mr decenso as you say the septuagint was a transl from hebrew togreek and you hav not shown the origin mean of the hebrew ie the thehebrew say and died and thu wheth it was simply echo in the greek it should also be point out that regardless of the ad and died thecorrect transl would stil be apacgw as the man did indee die fromstrang redund but correct  furth we hav evid that theseptuagint was rep rewrit and reedit which includ versionswhich contradict each oth and such edit was not ev necessarilyexecut by greek  thu i am not sur that you can us the septuagint as itnow stand as a paragon of ant greek  so what you real nee to proveyo point mr decenso is an exampl in ant greek of someon committingapacgw and surv  otherw i would see you as simply mak worthlessassert without correspond evid now i would not mr decenso that everytim i go out of my way to research iton of yo app cont exegis i pretty much find it fals  thus think that if you ar going to ad to the text someth ov and abovewh the sourc clear say then you had bet hav an explicit greek orh sourc to just it by the way as to mr ros stat about tre around the pot fieldunless mr ros can show that thes tre ar two thousand year old or thatth ar  year old stump ther or has a  thousand year old descriptionof the are which ment such tre then it is inappropry for him toassert that the pres plac of tre prov the loc of the tre twothousand year ago aft al thing chang now as to yo oth argu ie that the money juda us is not the samea the  silverstru pet or the auth of act doe not spec cal juda betray in but for that mat neith doe john spec cal judasact an in eith  furth john  did not say that juda took    som thought that becaus juda had the money box jes was tel     him buy what we nee for the feast or that he should giv someth     to the poor so aft receiv the morsel he immedy went out and     it was nightnot that it is said that juda left it doe not say that he took the moneybox  thu when i see yo expl it stil seem to me you would chooseth a an unprov in ment by anoth auth in a differentbook writ at a diff tim ov the in explicit ment byth auth of act  i find thi forc and cont of cours thi particul argu becom moot sint we hav hav seenevid that apacgw mean suicid  you see sint juda hang wassuccess he could not hav spent the money ment in john  becausematthew and mark explicit say the betray was on the high holy day iepassov and thu he could not hav spent the money bef kil himselfth next day  thu the money which bought the field of blood would hav tohav been the  piec of silv of cours he got the  piec of silverth night as wel and thu couldnt hav spent that eith  oh dear ibeliev that the hous of card is com down mayb we should at thi point discuss now wheth jes was cruc onfriday or saturday as that is now part of the argu about judasby the way as to wher the prophesy of the pot field cam from ie the of it in matthew you say am remind you now to discuss it now it al part of the sam vers wear discuss and i wish you would quit
